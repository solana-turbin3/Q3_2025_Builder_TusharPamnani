// This program implements a constant product Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Solana using Anchor.
//
// Features:
// - initialize: Sets up a new AMM pool with two token vaults, an LP mint, and configuration.
// - deposit: Allows users to add liquidity to the pool and mint LP tokens representing their share.
// - swap: Allows users to swap between the two tokens using the constant product formula (x*y=k).
// - withdraw: Allows users to burn their LP tokens and withdraw their proportional share of the pool's tokens.
//
// Each instruction is documented below and in the corresponding instruction module.
