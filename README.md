### 04. Vault

A Solana smart contract (Anchor) for secure SOL vault operations.  
**Features:**
- Users can initialize a personal vault (using PDAs for security).
- Deposit and withdraw SOL securely.
- Close the vault to reclaim rent and remaining funds.
- Built-in tests demonstrate the full lifecycle: initialize ‚Üí deposit ‚Üí withdraw ‚Üí close.
- Uses Anchor‚Äôs account validation and CPI for secure fund transfers.

**Key Concepts:**
- **PDAs (Program Derived Addresses):** Used for both vault state and vault accounts, ensuring only the owner can access funds.
- **Account Structure:** Vault state stores bump seeds for address derivation and security.

**How to use:**
- Build and deploy with Anchor CLI.
- Run tests to see transaction flows and account balances.
- See the escrow project‚Äôs README for sample commands and test output.

---

### 05. Escrow

A complete Anchor-based escrow system for secure SPL token swaps.  
**Features:**
- Users can create, accept, and refund escrow offers for SPL tokens.
- Two main programs: a simple SOL vault and a token escrow system.
- Includes a React frontend for interacting with the escrow contract.
- Comprehensive test suite for both vault and escrow flows.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Escrow Program:** Enables atomic swaps between two parties, ensuring both sides fulfill their obligations before tokens are released.
- **Vault Program:** Lets users securely store and manage SOL.
- **Frontend:** React app for user-friendly interaction with the escrow contract.

**How to use:**
- Install dependencies and build with Anchor.
- Deploy to localnet/devnet.
- Use the frontend or CLI to create and accept escrow offers.
- Run tests to verify all flows.

---

### 06. AMM

Automated Market Maker (AMM) built with Anchor and a Next.js frontend.  
**Features:**
- On-chain liquidity pools for token swaps.
- Instructions for swap, deposit, withdraw, and pool initialization.
- Uses the constant product formula for pricing (x*y=k).
- State management for pool reserves and user positions.
- Next.js frontend for interacting with the AMM on localhost.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Constant Product Curve:** Ensures fair pricing and liquidity for swaps.
- **Anchor Program:** Handles all pool logic, state, and validation.
- **Frontend:** Next.js app for easy pool interaction and visualization.

**How to use:**
- Build and deploy the Anchor program.
- Start the Next.js frontend (`npm run dev` in `amm-frontend`).
- Interact with pools, provide liquidity, and swap tokens via the UI.

### 07. escrow_mike

A modern, modular Anchor escrow implementation for teaching and real-world use.  
**Features:**
- Clean, warning-free builds with the latest Solana/Anchor/Rust.
- Modular handler structure: separate files for make_offer, take_offer, refund_offer, and shared logic.
- Comprehensive tests using Node.js and Anchor CLI.
- Designed for clarity and learning, with a full animated walkthrough available.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Handlers:** Each escrow action is implemented in its own handler for maintainability.
- **Offer State:** Tracks escrow offers and their status.
- **Testing:** Easy to run and extend, with clear output and CI integration.

**How to use:**
- Clone the repo and install dependencies.
- Run tests with `anchor test` (using the recommended toolchain).
- Deploy and interact with the program as described in the project README.
